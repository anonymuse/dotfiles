# Chrome Search Engines

## Search Engine Management

The engine_list.json is a list of custom engines added to the Chrome omnibar to
support rapid searching. I don't currently know of a way to enter this work
into Chrome directly, so I'll be creating a json object that contains all
required parameters

As we're using a json file to store the engines, I'm keeping the description of
functionality and usage in a separate README.

## Programmtic Entry

If possible, we'd like to manipulate Chrome settings files directly to manage
the available search engines, and prune undesired engines that are added.
